1. **You**: in this code ...fromdata is an object and imagelist is a array so is it correct way to write it
2. **ChatGPT**: Without seeing the code you are referring to, it is difficult to say whether the syntax is correct or not. However, in general, if `fromdata` is an object and `imagelist` is an array, the syntax to pass `imagelist` as a parameter to a method/function that expects an array would be something like this:

```
someMethod(fromdata, imagelist);
```

This would pass both `fromdata` and `imagelist` as parameters to the method `someMethod()`. However, the specific syntax may vary depending on the programming language and context in which the code is being used.
3. **You**: in this code ...fromdata is an object and imagelist is a array so is it correct way to write itsetResult({...formData},{imageList});
4. **ChatGPT**: Assuming that `itsetResult` is a function that takes two arguments, the first being an object and the second being an array, then your code is syntactically correct.

If `formData` is an object and `imageList` is an array, then `{...formData}` is a spread operator that creates a new object with all the properties of `formData` and `{imageList}` is shorthand for `{imageList: imageList}` which creates an object with a property `imageList` that contains the `imageList` array.

So the end result is that `itsetResult` would be called with an object as its first argument and an array as its second argument.

However, without more context, it's hard to say if this code is functionally correct or if it will behave as intended.
